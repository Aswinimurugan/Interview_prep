Self-Introduction:
"Hello, thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Aswini, and I'm thrilled to be here today. With a strong academic foundation in computer science, I've been fortunate to have a successful career in the IT industry, spanning over 3.6 years. Currently, I'm working as a DevOps and Site Reliability Engineer at CTS, where I've had the chance to develop a robust skill set in cutting-edge technologies like OpenShift, Dynatrace, Kafka, and more.
Throughout my career, I've consistently demonstrated my ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams, think innovatively, and automate repetitive tasks to drive efficiency. I'm passionate about staying up to date with industry best practices, which is why I've pursued certifications like Azure Fundamentals and Red Hat OpenShift Administrator Specialist.
In addition to my technical expertise, I bring a strong understanding of Azure cloud and Azure DevOps concepts and terraform. As a seasoned professional, I'm confident that I can leverage my wealth of knowledge and experience to make a meaningful impact in this role.
I'm excited about the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with the requirements of this position, and how I can contribute to the team's success. Thank you again for considering my profile, and I look forward to our conversation today."
Work Experience
"Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work in both DevOps and SRE roles, which has given me a unique perspective on the entire software development lifecycle. In my DevOps role, I worked on on-premises tools such as StarTeam for version control, Lunt build for configuration management, and SonarQube for code quality analysis. I implemented deployment scripts and configured Lunt build to automate the deployment process. When our client decided to migrate to GitHub, I led the effort to implement GitHub Actions workflows to build and deploy applications using self-hosted servers. This allowed us to automate the build and deployment process, improving efficiency and reducing manual errors.
Later, I transitioned to an SRE role, where I was responsible for the entire QA application and infrastructure. I worked closely with developers to maintain the health of their namespaces and applications and implemented monitoring and alerting using Dynatrace to ensure application reliability. I also monitored and troubleshot Kafka connectors during data bulk uploads, and automated recurring issues by analysing incidents and documenting troubleshooting steps in Confluence.
Overall, my experience in both DevOps and SRE roles has given me a deep understanding of the importance of automation, monitoring, and reliability in software development. I'm excited to bring my skills and experience to a new role and contribute to the success of the team."
