Developer --> Develop a code for your application in your personal system, text format of code will not help us to run it as application by end user
   |
Build --> convert the code into executable format (Maven, gradle,...)
   |
 Test --> test the code if there is any violation or vulnerabilities
   |
Deploy --> Deploy the build into target server to make it available for end user.

Git - helps developers to work on the same code at the same time and collabrote efficiently without conflicts
Teraform is used to provision the infrastructer and ansile is used to configure the tools/software after provisioning the infrastructure.

Devops Cycle
